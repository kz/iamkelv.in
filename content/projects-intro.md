Notable past projects from my secondary school and early university years. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvzhan/) profile for more recent, leadership and volunteering oriented work.

The below offers a glimpse into my early programming journey. I still vividly remember finding my first programming book at aged ten (_Visual Basic for Dummies_), building my [first Android app](https://github.com/kz/four-beat-tempo) in 2014, going to my first hackathon (MLH Launch Hack) the same October, followed by building my first mock-startup in a summer camp in Boston at [Leangap](https://www.leangap.org/) in 2015.

You can find 50+ other projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/kz?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=), but do bear in mind that the majority of these were built before university, at a time where my focus was solely on coding, contrasting against my current focus of developing well-rounded software engineering and leadership skills.
